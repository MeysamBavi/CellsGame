## Cells Game
#### Introduction
*Cells Game* is a more enhanced version of *Tic Tac Toe*, with 6 rows and 7 columns (by default), only you are limited to place marks over the alreadu marked cells.  
The game is run and played in terminal. place 4 marks in a row, column or cross before your opponent to win!

#### Run
compile both `Cells.java` and `Main.java` with `javac` command in your terminal. Then run `Main` with `java`;
        javac Cells.java Main.java
        java Main

**Have FUN!**

#### Suggestions
Feel free to edit and develope the source code; I've wrote the code in a way that compatible with different number of *rows*, *columns* and *consecutive marks* to win.
It just didn't make sense from a game designing perspective to have that!
