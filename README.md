## Cells Game
#### Introduction
*Cells Game* is a more enhanced version of *Tic Tac Toe*, with 6 rows and 7 columns (by default), only you are limited to place marks over the already marked cells; not just
anywhere you want! you can imagine the marks, fall down and stack up.
The game is run and played in console. place 4 marks in a row, column or cross before your opponent to win!

#### Run
You can download the java archive file [here](https://github.com/MeysamBavi/CellsGame/releases/download/v1.0.0/CellsGame.jar) and run the app with the command
```
java -jar CellsGame.jar
```
Alternatively, you can compile both `Cells.java` and `Main.java` with `javac` command in your terminal. Then run `Main` with `java` command;  
```
javac Cells.java Main.java     
java Main
```
**Have FUN!**

#### Suggestions
Feel free to edit and develope the source code; I've wrote the code in a way that is compatible with different number of *rows*, *columns* and *consecutive marks to win*.
It just didn't make sense from a game designing perspective to have it in the game!
